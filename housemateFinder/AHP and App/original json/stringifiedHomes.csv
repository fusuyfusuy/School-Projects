The location is fantastic, and although it is in the heart of Southbank (200m from the Southbank promenade and 500 metres from the Botanic Gardens) the complex itself is very calm and quiet.  Apartment: We're situated on the third (highest) floor of the complex, and this lends itself to a nice view of the complex garden, gym, pool, Eureka tower and the Art Gallery spire from the apartment balcony. The complex is also closed off, and has a caretaker to manage the gardens etc... which makes it very clean, safe and secure.The apartment itself has a large common area, balcony, high ceilings, and great natural light which creates a great open feel (it doesn't feel like the shoeboxes in the high-rise towers). The apartment has 3 bedrooms: Aji has his own bedroom and bathroom on the second level, whilst there are two bedrooms on the bottom level (the same level as the kitchen, common area, and the bathroom you will share with Kev). You can see the furniture we have from the photos, however the L-shaped couch is a bit tired, so if you have something better we'd be open to you bringing it in. Transport: Public transport is very easy, with Flinder St Station less than 10 minutes walk away, buses which run on Southbank Blvd, as well as plenty of trams on Sturt Street, Queensbridge Street, and St Kilda Rd just up the road. The 1 tram is only one block away. You will also have one free, secure, undercover car park for your own use as Kev and Aji don't have cars (and if needed we have access to another permit for street parking).  Groceries: South Melbourne Market is only a 15 minute walk away which has great fresh produce (this is a usual weekend activity for both Kev and Aji), however you also have access to an IGA across the road for when you can't be bothered, as well as an organic grocer (which makes great coffee) and Asian grocer only 100 metres away. All in all, it's a great place to live - you can't get a better, more central location which is as calm as it is, and you'll be living with two great housemates.","Art and culture && Bars, pubs or clubs && Business && Cooking and food && Creative interests && Current affairs && Health and fitness && Movie goer && Music && Reading && Socialising && Sports && Television && Travel","Aji works full-time as a lawyer.

Aji's been at the apartment for three years, and enjoys being walking distance to the city and the Botanic Gardens, and only short ubers or public transport to pretty much anywhere around inner Melbourne. Kev works in the creative department of an advertising agency. He's from Sydney, has lived in London and has visited over 30 countries.

Im trying to switch providers for all of them to get better deals so cant provide accurate indication of future costs, but  conservatively, for 2 people, id say electricity water and broadband amount to $170, so $85 each per month.

I would MUCH rather split the cost of a cleaner than live with someone who doesn't have the time to do their share of the work. And re: bills, splitting bills unequally may make sense (e.g. someone might work from home like every day and night, someone might have really bad circulation and want heating a lot). Basically, I want this to feel like home for all of us, and a decade of share housing experiences indicates directness, honesty and openness are critical in fostering good vibes and longevity.

I am 27 and work full time as a Manager in a global management consulting firm. I work fairly long hours and travel a bit for work, which I love. I am passionate about fitness and either go to the gym or run most days. While my partying days are getting behind me I love socialising on the weekend and heading out with mates to restaurants and bars. An ideal weeknight afternoon / evening for me is cooking with Emma, heading for a walk in Sydney Park and catching up on some trashy TV and yelling at the TV as a household. Emma - Hi i'm Emma, I'm 28 and work as a Lecturer and Researcher at UNSW in renewable energy. My job takes me on multiple trips a year across the globe including the US and China. I love cooking and am always trying to whip up new recipes that are healthy and challenging. I am passionate about current affairs and keeping up with the news and politics.  Emma and I purchased this house at the end of last year and have been living in it since mid-January. We love living in such a vibrant area that is so close to everything.
