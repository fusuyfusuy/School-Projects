Code for MIS 463 (2019/2020-1)  DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS FOR BUSINESS project. Original website was hosted on Wix. Used techs: HTML/CSS/JS, Bash.

---

The project was to create a decision support system. We used AHP.

Our goal was to make finding housemates or rooms easier. The system compares user's and house owner / tenant's preferences and tries to find the optimal room / roommate for the user. 

We scraped data from [FlatmateFinders](https://www.flatmatefinders.com.au/). We first tried setting up an API and creating a website crom scratch but eventually ended up using Wix. 

We made couple presentations at the class, and demonstrated the system.

The website is no longer live. The code can be run using `nodejs`.
