Code for MIS 463 (2020/2021-1) DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS FOR BUSINESS project. Works locally. Used techs: HTML/CSS/JS, Python (*Flask*). 

---

The project was to create a decision support system. We used AHP. 

Our goal was to gather data on bicycles, find out what people struggles with while choosing a bicycle and create a system which suggests bicycles based on user's preferences. 

We scraped data from various sources and decided to use [ChainReactionCycles](https://www.chainreactioncycles.com). We interviewed with professionals to learn which part of a bicycle is more important in which scenarios. We also interviewed and surveyed students about what they would like to see in a bicycle suggestion system. 

We made couple presentations at the class, and demonstrated the system.

To test the system, clone the repo, install the requirements with `pip3 install flask, flask_restful, flask_cors`, start the API using `python3 ./pycle-api/python3 app.py`, and run `firefox pycle-web/index.html`.
